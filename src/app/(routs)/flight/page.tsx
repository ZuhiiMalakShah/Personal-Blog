                        <p className="text-xl mb-6">
                        I am excited to showcase my latest project: a flight booking website featuring captivating scroll animations powered by AOS (Animate On Scroll), CSS, and HTML! üòäüí• This project was an incredible opportunity to create a visually engaging platform for booking flights with smooth animations and a clean, modern interface.</p>

                        The website offers a seamless browsing experience, allowing users to search for and book flights easily. As users explore the platform, elements like flight details, booking forms, and navigation features come alive with smooth scroll-triggered animations. The integration of AOS animations and custom CSS makes the website dynamic and engaging.
